# Elina

## Overview

A collection of some Minecraft utilities, with minimal change to vanilla gameplay, as usual.

Still, this is designed mainly for [my server, MCUCST](https://x.com/mcucst), and suggestions are welcomed.

## Components

### *locate*

A modification of vanilla *locate structure* command, allowing you to specify center, and mark visited structures, which is very useful on multiplayer servers.

### *map*

A wrapper of BlueMap API, and in the future many functions like subway system would be added.

Without BlueMap it simply does nothing, but stored data is preserved.

In the future more WebMap variants might be added.

## About the name

"Elina" could be a single name or concatenation of something, or nothing.

No official meaning or pronunciation would be specified here.
